# Self-navigational-robotic-car
This is a project about a robotic car capable of line tracking, routing and self parking.
The track contains straight parts, rectangular and circular parts; 
The intersections are labeled by hand written numbers indicating carports
The carports are perpendicular to the track, the robot need to pivot 90 degrees precisely.
I utilized supervised learning technique.
I used CNN and a full connection layer to build the network. I trained three models for distinctive tasks.
